- Documentation 
- Tutorials and Applications

#### Setting up the development environment
To hack on EVA, you need to checkout the repository and build EVA from the source.
Follow the following instructions to build EVA and test your changes locally.
We recommend using a virtual environment and the pip package manager. EVA requires JAVA 8 for generating the parser.
```
git clone https://github.com/georgia-tech-db/eva.git && cd eva
python3 -m venv env38                                # to create a virtual environment
. env38/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
sudo -E apt install -y openjdk-8-jdk openjdk-8-jre   # to install JAVA
sh script/antlr4/generate_parser.sh                  # to generate the EVA parser
python -m pip install install -e .[dev]
```

#### Submitting a contribution
Follow the following steps to contribute to EVA:
* Merge the most recent changes from the master branch 
```
    git remote add origin git@github.com:georgia-tech-db/eva.git
    git pull . origin/master
```
* Run the [test script](#testing) to ensure all the test cases pass.
* Run the `setup_git_hooks.sh` to add a git pre-push hook so that it runs the linter before pushing any changes.
* If you are adding a new SQL command, please add the example usage to the documentation. 

#### Testing
<a name="testing"></a>
Before merging the PR, the code must pass all the unit test cases. You can use the following script to run all the test cases locally.
```
bash script/test/test.sh
```
If you want to run a specific test file, use the following command.
```
python -m pytest test/integration_tests/test_select_executor.py
```
Use the following command to run a specific test case within a test file.
```
python -m pytest test/integration_tests/test_select_executor.py -k 'test_should_load_and_select_in_table'
```

#### Code Style
We use the [black](https://github.com/psf/black) code style for formatting our python code. For docstrings and documentation, we use [Google pydoc format](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).

```
def function_with_types_in_docstring(param1, param2) -> bool:
    """Example function with types documented in the docstring.

    Additional explanatory text can be added in paragraphs.

    Args:
        param1 (int): The first parameter.
        param2 (str): The second parameter.

    Returns:
        bool: The return value. True for success, False otherwise.

```

##### Lint and Formatting
Before merging, the PR must pass the code formatting and linting test case.
On your local machine, run the following script to auto-format using `black`

```
python script/formatting/formatter.py 
```
